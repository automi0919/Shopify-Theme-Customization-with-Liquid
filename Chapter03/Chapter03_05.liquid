{% case page.content.size %}
  {% when 150 %}
    The page has only 150 characters, so this should not take much time to read.
  {% when 350 %}
    We have bumped the page to 350 characters, but it should not take that much time.
  {% when 1000 %}
    We now have 1000 characters written, and it is going to take a few minutes to read everything carefully.
